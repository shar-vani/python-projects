# Projects Covered
# 1. Dice Rolling Simulator
# Objective: Create a program that simulates the rolling of a six-sided dice.

# Features:

# Generate a random number between 1 and 6.

# Allow the user to roll again or exit.

# Code Concepts Used:

# random module

# Loops and conditional statements

# Possible Enhancements:

# Add a feature to customize the number of sides on the dice.

# 2. Number Guessing Game
# Objective: Develop a game where the user guesses a randomly chosen number within a specific range.

# Features:

# Input validation for user guesses.

# Feedback on whether the guess is too high or low.

# Code Concepts Used:

# random module

# Loops and exception handling

# Possible Enhancements:

# Add difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard with varying ranges).

# 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
# Objective: Build a CLI version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game against the computer.

# Features:

# User input for choice (rock/paper/scissors).

# Random computer choice.

# Determine the winner.

# Code Concepts Used:

# random module

# Conditional logic

# Possible Enhancements:

# Add score tracking across multiple rounds.

# 4. QR Code Generator
# Objective: Create a tool to generate QR codes from user-provided input (e.g., URLs, text).

# Features:

# Input for text/URL.

# Save the generated QR code as an image file.

# Code Concepts Used:

# qrcode and Pillow libraries

# Possible Enhancements:

# Add customization options (e.g., color, size).
